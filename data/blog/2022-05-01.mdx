I think I accidentally became a wantrepreneur.

I've always had ideas and things I want to build. But every time I sit down to try and build something, "shiny object syndrome" kicks in and I spend all my time looking to understand different technologies and tools.

I _can_ code and build products. But I'm not very confident in my skills, so I end up going down the rabbit hole of "finding the best architecture." Since that doesn't exist (of course), I spend all my time doing research and trying to decide between learning to code vs. using no-code tools. That's the problem though: all I do is spend my time trying to figure out the best tools to use that I never actually spend time to using those tools.

This feeds into my other fear that I'm not moving fast enough. If I don't find the best architecture and do it fast, someone else will figure out the best solution for the problem I'm trying to solve and do it faster than I will.

The compounding effect is that I end up feeling a wantrepreneur. I'm already an ex-founder, so it's not like I haven't done this before. But my fears of going too slow and not knowing enough are holding me back and preventing me from building again. I keep talking about building ideas, but my lack of confidence in my speed and skills prevents me from doing anything.

So this is me trying to address my problems. I've come to the (obvious) conclusion that I need to start somewhere. I've decided that I'm going to finally learn to design and code. I believe that'll give me the confidence I really need to build something for a problem I want to solve. While doing that, I'll need to learn to acknowledge and accept that I might not be fast enough, but that's okay. There are problems everywhere, opportunities everywhere, and once I have the confidence then I can tackle them.

Thank you for reading what I hope to be the first of many posts on learning to code, building in public, and growth.
