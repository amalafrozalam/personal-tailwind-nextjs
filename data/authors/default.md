Hi!

I'm Amal Afroz Alam. I'm from Queens, New York. Born and raised.

I'm a biomedical engineer turned founder turned product manager. I enjoy building complicated products that have a lot of impact on users.

When not building new products, I spend my time in *too many* hobbies. Sometimes I blog about them here, so stick around and you might get a glimpse into them.

If you'd like to chat with me, work with me, or anything else, feel free to use the links below.
